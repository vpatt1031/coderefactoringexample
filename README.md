## Description 

This project covers the topics concerning code refactoring and accessibility. For this assignment I was tasked with the endeavor of refactoring the code of an existing marketing website to make it more accessible. Having semantic code is very important in increasing the accessibility of a website, and I was motivated to recode the div tags with more semantic elements. Without changing the functionality of the website, I modified the existing html code to conform to more semantic conventions. The css style sheet was also updated to reflect the changes in html code, as well as reduce repetitive code. Instead of having multiple classes to achieve the same styling, one class was created to apply to different sections, resulting in what I hope is cleaner code. I was unclear if the old code I commented out should remain in the style sheet to reflect my changes, or if it should be deleted, but from a professional stand point, I decided deleting the old code would be a better practice.
